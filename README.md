# xml-parser
A XML parser written using gnu bison and flex.

I wrote this legacy parser in 2001 to be used on Sun Solaris and Windows95 :) I tried to make on
my Apple OS X Yosemite but it did not build due to some obsolete compile flags. Same thing for my Ubuntu Linux. Anyway, this should be a fair parser development example using gnu bison and flex (lex and yacc), I believe.

I will fix the issues if there is a request but I will let this sleep till such message is received.
