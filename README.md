# xml-parser
A XML parser written using gnu bison and flex.

I wrote this in 2001 to be used on Sun Solaris and Windows95 :) I tried to make on
my Apple OS X Yosemite but it did not build due to some obsolete compile flags.
Same thing for my Ubuntu Linux. This should be a good example of using gnu bison and flex
I believe.

I will fix the issues if there is a request but I will let this sleep 
till such message is received.
