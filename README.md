# XML-Parser
A very old xml parser I wrote in 2001! 

I wrote this in 2001 to be used on Sun Solaris and Windows95 :) I tried to build on
my MAC OS X Yosemite but it failed due to some obsolete compile flags.
Same thing for my Ubuntu Linux. 

Anyway this should be a good example of using gnu bison and flex, I believe.

I will fix the issues if there is a request but I will let this sleep 
till such message is received.
